#Devlopment Journal Entry #1 
##02/05/16

Today we looked at the main features of our app. We wanted to outline everything before we got started on the actual coding part 
so today consisted us drafting a document about specific things we wanted to include in the app, how hard would it be to implement 
these things, and can we implement all of these things before the deadline on May 27th. We created a text file with all the features, 
we listed out the main groups we wanted to do, so the main points. Main points like Google Intergation etc. We discussed what possible
features will be the most useful to the audience we are aiming at. We had some good main points (I won't list them because you'll see them later)
but within those main points we had a lot of subgroupings of things we are going to do to make those main features worked. I made that
file into a .md file and also pushed it to our repository. That was maily it, it was planning for today, getting all our ideas in sync
with each other. Tomorrow we will be meeting up and hopefully starting some of the coding bits.
