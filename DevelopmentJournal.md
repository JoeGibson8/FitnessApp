Development Journal
Jai and I are planning to meet on February 6th for a few hours. During this time period, we will go and map out our plan for the project. We are thinking of not coding an accelerometer for our fitness app, but we instead are going to focus on having our app be able to take in user data for different exercises and use that information to make recommendations for exercising a certain body part. To be more specific, we plan to include features for Google Integration such as nutritional values and language. Also, we plan to have a gui that shows the human body and allows the user to select the desired muscle group to be worked out. In addition, there will be a workout planner which will allow the user to make a list of suggested exercises or custom exercises. There will also be fitness profiles that will allow for ever user to access their own personal data. Also, the app will record data such as calories of foods eaten. The name of our app will be FitAddiction.
